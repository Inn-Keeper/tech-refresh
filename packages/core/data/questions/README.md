# Question bank

Source of truth for the tiered quiz `questions` table. One JSON file per
category; each entry is one question:

```json
{
  "tech": "TypeScript",
  "category": "Languages",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "prompt": "…",
  "options": ["correct answer", "distractor", "distractor", "distractor"],
  "correct": 0,
  "explanation": "Why the right answer is right."
}
```

## Conventions

- **`correct` is the index into `options`.** By convention the right answer is
  authored at index `0`; options are shuffled at runtime by `shuffleOptions()`
  in `packages/core/src/quiz.js`, so order on screen is randomized.
- **Exactly 4 options**, all non-empty.
- **`difficulty`** ∈ `easy` (🐣 Newbie) · `mid` (😎 Can-Do) · `high` (🔥 Full
  Speed) · `ultra` (💀 Overlord). See `packages/core/src/difficulty.js`.
- **No duplicate prompt** within the same `(tech, difficulty)` bucket.

Everything above is enforced by `validateQuestionSet()`
(`packages/core/src/questions.js`), which runs in both the content test
(`__tests__/questions-data.test.js`) and the seed script.

## Adding / growing a batch

Target ~20 per level per tech, authored in reviewable per-tech batches. Add
entries to the matching category file, then:

```bash
pnpm --filter @tech-refresh/core test   # validates structure + no duplicates
SUPABASE_URL=… SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=… node scripts/seed-questions.mjs
```

The seed script replaces each `(tech, difficulty)` bucket it finds, so
re-running after edits is safe and idempotent.

## Coverage status

All 50 technologies across 9 categories are seeded at 5 questions per tier
(20 per tech) — **1,000 questions total**.

| Category           | File                   | Techs |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Languages          | `languages.json`       | 6     |
| Frontend & Mobile  | `frontend-mobile.json` | 11    |
| Backend            | `backend.json`         | 6     |
| Cloud & DevOps     | `cloud-devops.json`    | 6     |
| Monitoring         | `monitoring.json`      | 5     |
| AI Tooling         | `ai-tooling.json`      | 3     |
| Testing            | `testing.json`         | 4     |
| Mobile Delivery    | `mobile-delivery.json` | 1     |
| Databases & CRM    | `databases-crm.json`   | 8     |

To deepen a tier from 5 toward 20 questions, add more entries to the relevant
file and re-run the test + seed script — both are idempotent per
`(tech, difficulty)` bucket.
