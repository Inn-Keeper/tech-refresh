// Pushback fires when something is right — the interviewer points at a box you
// drew and asks you to defend it. Drawing a cache is the easy half; saying how
// it's invalidated is the half that gets graded.
//
// Two sources, so all 100 scenarios are covered without 300 hand-written rules:
//   1. Per-node probes, derived from what's actually on the board.
//   2. One scenario-specific question, authored per scenario in scenarios.js.

/** Follow-ups stay short enough to actually answer in a round. */
